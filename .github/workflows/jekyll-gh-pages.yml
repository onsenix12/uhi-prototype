# Sample workflow for building and deploying a Jekyll site to GitHub Pages
name: Deploy Jekyll with GitHub Pages dependencies preinstalled

#
# NOTE:
# This repository hosts a React (Create React App) project, not a Jekyll site.
# GitHub Pages should deploy the built React app via the "Deploy React app to GitHub Pages" workflow.
# To avoid conflicting deployments, this workflow is disabled by default.
#
# If you ever need to use Jekyll for this repo, you can re-enable the workflow
# by changing the following `on:` block back to a normal trigger (e.g. push).
#

on:
  # Disabled: only allow manual runs if explicitly needed
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false
